What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","  - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is renowned for being easy to understand and use. Guido van Rossum created it, and it was first made available in 1991. In comparison to other programming languages, Python's design prioritises code readability and enables developers to write fewer lines of code.\n","  The reasons are ; Easy to Learn and Use: Python is beginner-friendly due to its straightforward syntax, which is similar to natural language. Versatile: Applied to a wide range of domains, including cybersecurity, automation, AI, machine learning, data science, and web development. Strong Community Support: Its ecosystem is made up of a large number of developers who ensure ongoing enhancements and a wealth of resources. Rich Libraries and Frameworks: Python is made powerful for a variety of applications by libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Django, and Flask. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows and almost all the comapies like google ,facebook use python for various purposes.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","   - A Python interpreter is a computer program that executes Python statements one at a time compared to a compiler, which translates the entire code in one go. A Python interpreter translates Python code into machine code that the computer can easily comprehend and execute.\n","   How the Python Interpreter Operates: Interprets the Python source code (in .py files). Translates and converts the code into an intermediate form called bytecode. Executes the bytecode in the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), which interacts with the computer operating system. General Python Interpreters CPython – The default and most used Python interpreter. PyPy – JIT compiled interpreter with improved speed. Jython – Runs Python programs inside the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). IronPython – Interoperates with.NET and executes Python on the.NET platform. MicroPython – For microcontrollers and embedded systems. You can run the Python interpreter in interactive mode by simply typing python (or python3) at your terminal or command line.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","   - False await else import pass None break except in raise True class finally is return and continue for lambda try as def from nonlocal while assert del global not with async elif if or yield.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","   - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in most programming languages because they have special meanings and are reserved for specific functions within the language.\n","\n","     For example, in Python if = 7 # ❌ This will cause a syntax error because \"if\" is a keyword\n","\n","     However, you can work around this by slightly modifying the name: if_value = 7 # ✅ This is valid\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","   - Mutability in Python refers to whether an object can be changed after it is created. Python objects are categorized into mutable and immutable types.\n","\n","     Mutable Objects (Can Be Changed) Mutable objects allow modification after creation. Examples include:\n","\n","     Lists (list) Dictionaries (dict) Sets (set)my_str = \"hello\" my_str[0] = \"H\" # This will cause an error\n","\n","     Byte Arrays (bytearray) EXAMPLES-- my_list = [1, 2, 3] my_list[0] = 99 # Modifies the list print(my_list) # Output: [99, 2, 3]\n","\n","     Immutable Objects (Cannot Be Changed) Immutable objects cannot be modified after creation. Any change creates a new object. EXAMPLES--- Integers (int) Floating points (float) Strings (str) Tuples (tuple) Booleans (bool)\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","   -  :Lists are mutable: You can modify a list after its creation (e.g., add, remove, or change elements).\n","\n","     :Tuples are immutable: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. my_list = [1, 2, 3] my_list.append(4) # Adding an element my_list[0] = 10 # Modifying an element print(my_list) # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4]\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","  - In Python, == and is are both comparison operators, but they serve  \n","     different purposes:\n","\n","     1- == (Equality Operator)\n","\n","     Checks if two values are equal. Compares the contents (or values) of two objects. Example a = [1, 2, 3] b = [1, 2, 3] print(a == b) # True (because their contents are the same)\n","\n","     2- (Identity Operator)\n","\n","     Checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory. Compares the identity (memory address) of two objects. Example a = [1, 2, 3] b = [1, 2, 3] print(a is b) # False (because they are different objects in memory)\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","  - Logical operators in Python are used to perform logical operations on boolean values (True and False). These operators are commonly used in conditional statements, loops, and decision-making constructs.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","  - Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into\n","   another. It can be done using built-in functions like:\n","\n","     int() – Converts to an integer float() – Converts to a floating-point number str() – Converts to a string list(), tuple(), set() – Converts to respective collection types\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","   - 1-> Implicit Type Casting (Type Promotion) Done automatically by the compiler. Happens when converting a smaller data type to a larger one. No data loss occurs. Example: int a = 10; float b = a; // Implicit conversion from int to float.\n","\n","     2 -> Explicit Type Casting (Type Conversion) Done manually by the programmer. Used when converting a larger data type to a smaller one. May cause data loss or precision loss. Example: float x = 10.99; int y = (int)x; // Explicit conversion from float to int (truncates decimal part).\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","   - A conditional statement in Python is used to check in a program whether a condition is True or False. It allows the program to execute different pieces of code depending on certain conditions.\n","\n","     Purpose of Conditional Statements: Control Flow: They help control the flow of code depending on conditions. Decision-Making: They allow the program to do various things based on user input, sensor reading, or other factors. Error Handling: They can prevent errors by checking conditions before executing some operations. Loop Control: They can be utilized to break loops or skip iterations based on some conditions.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","    -  Python elif is \"else if.\" It is used when you have more than one condition to check and you would prefer to execute various parts of code depending on which condition is True.\n","\n","     How it works: The program then checks the if condition. If the if condition is True, then that piece of code runs and the rest of the elif and else statements are skipped. When the if condition is False, then the code jumps to the elif condition. If elif condition is True, its block will be executed and others will be skipped. If none of the if or elif conditions are met, the else statement (if present) runs as default.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","   -  The main difference between a for loop and a while loop is that a for loop is used when you know the number of iterations beforehand, while a while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition. Here's a more detailed explanation: For Loop: Used when you know exactly how many times you want the code to repeat. Typically used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or a range of numbers). The loop's structure includes initialization, condition, and increment/decrement statements in a single line, making it concise and easy to read. Example: for i in range(5): print(i) (This will print numbers 0 to 4) While Loop: Used when you don't know how many times the code needs to repeat, and the loop continues until a specific condition is met. The loop's condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration, and the loop continues as long as the condition is true. Example: count = 0; while count < 5: print(count); count += 1 (This will print numbers 0 to 4).\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","   - A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when the number of iterations is not known in advance and the loop should continue running based on a condition rather than a fixed range.\n","\n","     Scenario: User Input Validation Imagine you're writing a program that asks a user to enter a positive number. If the user enters a negative number or zero, the program should keep asking untill they enter a valid positive number.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"EDQPHco9KgDF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Based Questions\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"5acwWzzDAXpH"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
